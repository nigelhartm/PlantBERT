## Abstract
The impact of transformer architecture on natural language processing has inspired innovative applications in various domains. There are already various large language models for biological data, such as DNABERT2, majorly focussing on human and animal data. However, the model for plants does not exist. Therefore we developed a specialized model, PlantBERT, uniquely designed for the plant genome. By utilizing cutting-edge methods, the model showed promising results in the pre-training phase, with high accuracy, compared to DNABERT2. Further fine-tuning both models for a binary classification task was focused on plant promoter detection, demonstrating the models efficiency in addressing domain-specific challenges. With just half the model size, PlantBERT yielded results in this task that were similar to those of DNABERT2. This shows the necessity for the model tailored to the plant genome. This study not only shows the practicality of constructing PlantBERT but also establishes a robust foundation for future research. The accomplishment expands the plant genomics research and emphasizes the potential of tailored language models in specialized scientific domains. PlantBERT provides advancements in our understanding of plant genomic sequences and establishes a foundation for continuous innovation in the field.

## How to use?
The training and evaluation of the model was succesful. This repository still needs some make-over, until then I recommend to directly download my pre-trained model from hugging-face for fine-tuning.
